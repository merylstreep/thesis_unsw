# Improved turbulence modelling using gene expression programming techniques
### Final year thesis for Aerospace Engineering (Hons.) and Computer Science @ UNSW

##### Motivations
Turbulence continues to be a subject of engineering interest as leading modelling techniques are still in large part an over-simplification of complex flow physics.
Potentially critical information at smaller scales which influence the appearance of large scale flow features is being lost under these models. Additionally, many models are only successful within a particular set of flow constraints.

Advanced computing techniques have the potential in unlocking the underlying characteristics of turbulent flows by systematically reducing high-fidelity data common to fluid mechanics and extracting novel, generalised solutions. Gene expression programming (GEP) in particular has recently demonstrated great success at producing insightful mathematical relationships via symbollic regression.
This thesis seeks to develop a generalised turbulence model using GEP techniques under the DEAP development framework. GEP will be used to obtain a novel closure expression for RANS-integrated learning during the evolutionary process.
It is hoped that this thesis will: 
1. Produce an accurate turbulence model for a range of flow cases
2. Provide insight into best parameterising the model development process
3. Play a role in advancing the intersection of fluid mechanics and machine learning
